  abstract = "Resumen El presente trabajo abarca a la alimentación de los mayas
              precolombinos desde tres ángulos: el perfil taxonómico de los
              animales consumidos, la relación entre agricultura/ecología y la
              obtención de los animales selváticos y la reconstrucción de
              algunos fragmentos de la cuisine de los mayas, basada en evidencia
              zooarqueológica y tafonómica. La primera parte del texto presenta
              listas de animales vertebrados que pudieron haber formado parte de
              la dieta maya, debido a que sus restos se encontraron en basureros
              asociados a estructuras habitacionales. A lo largo del área maya
              se manifiesta un patrón semejante, sobresaliendo el venado cola
              blanca (Odocoileus virginianus) como uno de los taxa más
              frecuentemente consumidos. El uso de una gama reducida pero
              característica de taxa que se repite con cierta constancia entre
              los sitios precolombinos permite relacionar la caza de animales
              con el uso y la transformación de la tierra en el área maya. El
              cultivo de la milpa parece haber propiciado la presencia de
              determinados taxa, importantes para el consumo. Por último, las
              marcas en los huesos de animales encontrados en los basureros
              permiten suponer que en el área maya se utilizaba, desde tiempos
              precolombinos, un método tradicional de cocción conocido hoy día
              como píib. The present article reviews pre-Columbian Maya diet
              from three different angles: the taxonomic profile of the
              presumably consumed animals, the relationship between
              agriculture/ecology and animal hunting in the surroundings of the
              settlements, and finally, the reconstruction of some aspects of
              the maya cuisine, based on zooarchaeological and taphonomic
              evidence. The first part of the text presents lists of vertebrate
              animals that are presumed to have formed part of the maya diet
              because their remains were found in middens associated with
              residential structures. Throughout the maya area taxonomic studies
              emphasize the white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) as one of
              the species most widely and frequently found in archaeological
              deposits. Also, the use of a relatively narrow range of taxa that
              are consistently found at most pre-Columbian sites allows us to
              relate the hunt of those animals to land use and transformation in
              the maya environment. Corn cultivation appears to have led to the
              increased presence of certain taxa that were important to the
              ancient maya diet. Lastly, the marks on the faunal bones excavated
              from these middens allow us to hypothesize about early evidence
              for a traditional cooking method, the píib, possibly used since
              pre-Columbian times.",

  abstract  = "Mesolithic populations from coastal areas are known as
               hunter-gatherer-fishers. This way of life is visible in the
               landscape owing to the presence of large accumulations of shells
               named shell middens. These anthropogenic refuse heaps are
               composed of high proportions of marine resources, yet studies
               dedicated to marine components are relatively recent. Efforts
               have been made to record marine molluscs, but other minorities
               are still invisible as a result of the small sizes of
               archaeological remains. Crustaceans are one of these minorities
               and this article will focus on one of them: crabs. Why are these
               decapods persistently ignored by most of archaeologists? Is this
               due to the scant presence of their remains in Mesolithic shell
               middens? An overview of published data on crabs is presented here
               for the Mesolithic period on the European Atlantic façade. The
               proportions of shell middens comprising these crustaceans is
               evaluated, as well as quantities and identified species. We
               endeavour to identify the potential impact of excavation methods
               and sampling on our knowledge of this marine resource. We present
               the methods developed to extract data from small archaeological
               crab remains and show how, from a fragment of a crab finger
               extremity, we can identify the species and estimate the original
               size of crabs. This methodological challenge has a major impact
               on our knowledge of past maritime populations.",
